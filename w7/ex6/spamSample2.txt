Good morning Mandy, I hope you had a great weekend.

I am writing to you about the issue we're having with this fence. It's already a year since this happened and it's not resolved.

The new damages made things even worse, more than half of the fence being down.
By the looks of their garden it seems that they don't even go there/don't care about the status of it.

But this affects me. The same as it affects me that they throw their cigarettes in front of my house. I am giving my best to keep the house in good shape, but these issues make me feel my effort is in vain. The plastic fence is not acceptable.
For me as an individual it's difficult to deal with this given that I am not the owner of the house. But this needs to be sorted as this is not the status I signed up for paying.
If nothing is done about it I expect my rent to be reduced.
In hindsight I am sure the company would have a hard time giving the house for rent in this status.

Kind regards,
Florin
